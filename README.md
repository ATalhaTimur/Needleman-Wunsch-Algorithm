# Needleman-Wunsch-Algorithm
This project implements the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for dynamic pairwise sequence alignment. Crucial in bioinformatics, sequence alignment compares DNA sequences to understand genetic relationships, evolution, and genomics. The goal is to align DNA sequences optimally using predefined scoring for matches, mismatches, and gaps.
